### Setting up your Raspberry Pi using Google Coder

The Raspberry Pi is a barebones computer. It’s really pretty useless on its own. In order to puse it as a webserver and create websites on it, we need to connect a number of things to it:

- An SD card. This card contains the Google Coder that can be loaded onto the Raspberry Pi in order for it to do things. You need to slide the card into the slot with the metal pins facing in towards the Raspberry Pi. The label should be visible when it is inserted.
- An ethernet cable or wifi adapter. This will allow you to connect the Raspberry Pi to a local network to host your website projects on.
- A power adapter. Plug the power adapter into a socket and then the small USB connector into the Raspberry Pi. When you turn the socket switch on, you should see the Raspberry Pi flash and text should appear on the monitor.

*Note: A monitor, keyboard & mouse are not necessary, as you will connect to the RPi from a computer internet browser on the same network.*

### Connect to your Raspberry Pi Coder Server

Now you have connected your Raspberry Pi to the local network you can use a computer and laptop to connect to it. You will see that after you plugged in the power cable to the RPi some lights came on, this indicates that your RPi Coder server is booting up. 

1. Give it a few minutes to boot, and then in your web broswer on your computer type:

  ```
  http://coder.local/
  ```
  Don't forget the `http://` part!

2. Or to the Coder number given to you by your teacher. e.g. `http://coder01.local/` or `http://coder02.local/` 

3. Once connected you will see a screen asking you to setup a password to protect your server. With your partner set a password. *Note: You will need to make sure that you remember your password every lesson, or your work will be lost. Why not use the RPi default password `raspberry`*

###Create your own website:

Once connected to your Coder webserver you will to create a new Coder App. On the main Coder page you will see a grid of boxes with names on them. These are projects (also called apps), and there are a few that come pre-installed on Coder. Some of them are simple (like Hello Coder) 


and can help you become more familiar with the program. Others are more sophisticated (like Space Rocks!) and show the potential of what you can build. But you can take a look at those anytime. 

1. Go to the upper left of the screen and click on the green box with a plus sign.

2. Click the plus to start creating a new app.

3. Give your app a name and pick a color. Don’t worry, you can change both of these later if you decide you don’t like them. Once you’ve got a name and color, press **Create.** You should go straight into editing your new project.
