### Setting up your Raspberry Pi using Google Coder





###Create your own website:

Once connected to your Coder webserver you will to create a new Coder App. On the main Coder page you will see a grid of boxes with names on them. These are projects (also called apps), and there are a few that come pre-installed on Coder. Some of them are simple (like Hello Coder) and can help you become more familiar with the program. Others are more sophisticated (like Space Rocks!) and show the potential of what you can build. But you can take a look at those anytime. 

1. Go to the upper left of the screen and click on the green box with a plus sign.

2. Click the plus to start creating a new app.

3. Give your app a name and pick a color. Don’t worry, you can change both of these later if you decide you don’t like them. Once you’ve got a name and color, press **Create.** You should go straight into editing your new project.
