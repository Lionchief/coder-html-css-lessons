## Lesson 1 - What are Websites?

###Introduction

Google Coder allows creating websites simple, fun, and sneakily educational things that can all be made with Coder and Rasberry Pi. It’s a free piece of software that turns a Raspberry Pi into a simple, tiny, personal web server and web-based development environment--just what you need for crafting HTML, CSS, and Javascript while you’re learning to code.

Hopefully, you’ve already downloaded and installed Coder for Raspberry Pi from the offical Google Coder website. If you haven’t (or aren’t sure what Coder is) you can read about it here: http://goo.gl/coder.
