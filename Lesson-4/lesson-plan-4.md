### Starter

Create student groups of 2 or 3 and give each group a set of [HTML cards](). Students are to match the HTML tag with the correct answer card. After a few minutes select each group to feed back one card to the rest of the class. 


### Main Development

1. Remind the class how to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers ensuring that students are allocated the correct SD card that they used in the previous lesson. Ensure they they can all log in. Students can use the [Student Instructions](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-4/student-instructions-4.md) as a guide to remind them of the steps.
