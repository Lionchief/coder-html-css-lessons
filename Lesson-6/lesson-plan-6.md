# Lesson 6 - Feedback & Evaluation

##Introduction

In this lesson students will reflect on their webpage design and that of their peers, for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability. This is an important part of creating any digital artifact in computing that can be overlooked. 

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what makes a good webpage design
- Be able to apply feedback from others to their webpage design in order to improve it
- Evaluate a webpage design against a criteria

## Learning Outcomes

###All students are able to:

- explain their likes and dislikes about a webpage design
- set some criteria for others to evaluate their webpage by

###Most students are able to:

- provide relevant feedback to their peers on webpage design


###Some students are able to:

- explain the good and bad points about their webpage design, with attention to trustworthiness, design and useability.


## Lesson Summary
- Class discussion on reviewing website design
- Setup of Raspberry Pi Google Codr webservers
- Peer assessment against criteria
- Self evaluation against criteria
- Improved webpages based on feedback and evaluation


## Starter

For homework from the previous lesson, students were asked to review a website of their choice by answering the following questions:

- What is the name of the website?
- Who is the target audience?
- Do you think it is well designed or badly designed and why?
- Are the colours easy on the eye? 
- Is the layout clear and uncluttered?

Select students to feedback their reviews to the rest of the class. Draw out from these reviews evaluation criteria that students identified as being important and display them on the board. Discuss what makes a good webpage design.

## Main Development

1. Ask students to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers, then log in and open their webpages that they have been working on. 

2. Next ask students to swap seats with a partner. Using the critera generated at the start of the lesson, students should review their partners webpage, giving relevant helpful suggestions for improvement. Affterwards students should return to their seats, read the feedback carefully and make an improvement to their webpage that was suggested. A note of the improvement could be made on the students blog or eportfolio if they have one.

3. Using the same criteria, students should then self evaluate their webpage and make any impovements that they see fit. A note of the improvements could be added to a blog or eportfolio to record the changes.

## Plenary

Select students to explain the journey their website design took during this lesson: 
	- How did the webpage start the lesson looking like? 
	- What improvements were suggested by others 
	- What changed as a result of the feedback
	- If they were to start the proejct again, what would they do differently?

If students have access to a blog or eportfolio they could answer these questions in writing, completeing them for homework.
