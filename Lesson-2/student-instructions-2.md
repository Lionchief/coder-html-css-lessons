### Setting up your Raspberry Pi using Google Coder

The Raspberry Pi is a barebones computer. It’s really pretty useless on its own. In order to puse it as a webserver and create websites on it, we need to connect a number of things to it:

- An SD card. This card contains the Google Coder that can be loaded onto the Raspberry Pi in order for it to do things. You need to slide the card into the slot with the metal pins facing in towards the Raspberry Pi. The label should be visible when it is inserted.
- An ethernet cable or wifi adapter. This will allow you to connect the Raspberry Pi to a local network to host your website projects on.
- A power adapter. Plug the power adapter into a socket and then the small USB connector into the Raspberry Pi. When you turn the socket switch on, you should see the Raspberry Pi flash and text should appear on the monitor.

*Note: A monitor, keyboard & mouse are not necessary, as you will connect to the RPi from a computer internet browser on the same network.*

### Connect to your Raspberry Pi Coder Server

Now you have connected your Raspberry Pi to the local network you can use a computer and laptop to connect to it. You will see that after you plugged in the power cable to the RPi some lights came on, this indicates that your RPi Coder server is booting up. 

1. Give it a few minutes to boot, and then in your web broswer on your computer type:

  ```
  http://coder.local/
  ```
  Don't forget the `http://` part!

2. Or to the Coder number given to you by your teacher. e.g. `http://coder01.local/` or `http://coder02.local/` 

3. Once connected you will see a screen asking you to setup a password to protect your server. With your partner set a password. *Note: You will need to make sure that you remember your password every lesson, or your work will be lost. Why not use the RPi default password `raspberry`*

### Make a New Coder Webpage

On the main Coder page you will see a grid of boxes with names on them. These are projects (also called apps), some are webapges, and some are game. There are a few that come pre-installed on Coder. Last lesson you looked at the **Hello Coder** app.

1. At the top left of the screen you should see a green box with a plus sign. Click the **plus** to start creating a new app.

2. Give it a name and pick a color. You are going to make a webpage containing a recipe so give it a name to reflect it's contents like "The Perfect Victoria Sponge - by Miss Philbin".

3. Once you’ve got a name and color, press **Create**. You should go straight into editing your new project.
