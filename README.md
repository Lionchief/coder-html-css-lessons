[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/watch?v=wH24YwdayFg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH24YwdayFg)


###Introduction

[Google Coder](http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder/) is a free, open source project that turns a Raspberry Pi into a simple platform that educators and parents can use to teach the basics of building for the web. New coders can craft small projects in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, right from the web browser.

This scheme of work is specifically targetted towards KS2/KS3 Computing. This has been developed in harmony with the new Computing curriculum in the UK. 

###Students will learn:

Over the course of six lessons, students will learn:

- How to turn a Raspberry Pi into a webserver.
- How to create webpages using html & css in particular:
	- Basic html
	- Lists
	- Adding images and videos
	- Adding style
	

###Computing Programme of Study Met:

**KS2:**

- Understand computer networks, including the internet; how they can provide multiple services, such as the World Wide Web, and the opportunities they offer for communication and collaboration.
- Select, use and combine a variety of software (including internet services) on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs, systems and content that accomplish given goals, including collecting, analysing, evaluating and presenting data and information.

**KS3:**

- Understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems.
- Create, reuse, revise and repurpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability.

###Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below, and a computer with a web broswer connected to the network each. As there will be multipule Raspberry Pis acting as servers some setup is required in configuring them. [See multipule coder devices setup guide](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/coder/wiki/Using-Multiple-Coder-Devices-(Lab-Setup). In addition, it is suggested that you have your own teacher setup connected to a projector screen for demonstration purposes.

- A Raspberry Pi per pair connected to a local network;
- An [SD card with Google Coder installed](http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder/) per RPi and configured to allow multipule coder devices; 
- A computer per student with a web browser connected to local network.
